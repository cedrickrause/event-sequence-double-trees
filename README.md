# Vue-Dashboard-Boilerplate

This project is intended to be a good starting point for dashboard-like Vue.js projects. It should provide properly engineered guidelines that can be extended to the needs of the specific project.
There is also an example component for a scatterplot that contains the main ideas on how to build and connect different charts / components. In the future, more basic visualizations might be added that follow
the same principles.
